# Vector Map Style Profiler üó∫Ô∏èüìèüé®

This repository contains tools for profiling the performance of various vector map styles using [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js).

## Online Tool

Visit the [Vector Map Style Profiler website](https://01100100.github.io/mapStyleProfile) to test the load and render times of [MapLibre styles](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/).

Bring your own style and observe how long it takes to load and render the map.

Code for the site is located in the `site/src/index.html` file.

### External Resources

The website relies on [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js), included via a CDN link, to render maps.

## Automated browser testing

The `src/main.py` Python script automates browser testing across multiple styles using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro). It captures load times, takes screenshots, and outputs results to `timing_results.json`.

### Docker

The Vector Map Style Profiler can be run in a Docker container. A Dockerfile is included in the repository. To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t map-style-profiler .
```

To run the Docker container with a mounted volume for the outputted files, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --ipc=host -v ${PWD}/:/output --env-file=.env map-style-profiler
```

## Results website

The results of the automated browser testing are displayed on a website such that the different styles can be compared. The site uses `echarts` to visualize the `timing_results.json` file that is generated by the automated browser testing script. This is written in typescript that is compiled and injected into the `results.html` file using webpack.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can access the results by visiting the following URL: [https://01100100.github.io/mapStyleProfile/results](https://01100100.github.io/mapStyleProfile/results).

### Serving the site locally

```bash
cd site/
npm install
npm run serve
```

*Note: The site uses the `timing_results.json` file generated by the automated browser testing script. Make sure to run the automated browser testing script before serving the site locally.*

## Github Actions

The project uses Github Actions to run the automated browser testing script, build the results site and deploy it. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Contributions

Contributions to the Vector Map Style Profiler project are greatly appreciated. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

To add a new style for testing, update the `styles` list in `src/main.py`.

*Note: an API keys is required for some styles. API keys are set as a github repository secret. If you would like to contribute a style from a new provider, please contact me such that I can configure a API key for the new provider.*
