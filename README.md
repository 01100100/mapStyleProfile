# Vector Map Style Profiler üó∫Ô∏èüìèüé®

The Vector Map Style Profiler is a tool that allows you to profile the performance of different vector map styles. It takes a [MapLibre style](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/) as a input and displays timing information about how long it took to load and render the map on the page.

## External Resources

The site depends on [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) to draw the map on the page. The library is included in the site through a content delivery network (CDN) link.

## Hosting

The Vector Map Style Profiler is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can access the app by visiting the following URL: [https://01100100.github.io/mapStyleProfile](https://01100100.github.io/mapStyleProfile).
